    <p>PART 1</p>
    <p>Welcome to the Perfect Clear guide, which will teach everything about the PC/AC clear in
      modern tetris.</p>

    <p>Intro</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Awarded when a line clear leaves the board with no more pieces on it</li>
      <li>Sends +10 attack, as well as the line clear attack</li>
      <li>Example, a quad sends 4 lines. If the quad also PC's, it sends 4+10, which is 14</li>
      <li>Mainly done as an opener, and can be looped</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Benefit and Disadvantages</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sends LOTS of attack</li>
      <li>Can be done relatively fast depending on method</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Hard to learn the whole topic</li>
      <li>Mostly luck based IMO</li>
      <li>Can be stopped if received 1 line of attack</li>
    </ul>
    <p>4 line PC Openers</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The most common opener to PC with is the perfect clear opener, with a 60-80% to PC</li>
      <li>It has a simple shape to remember and mostly simple solves</li>
      <li>This relies on the I piece being held to get higher percent chances to solve</li>
      <li>Here is pattern to learn:</li>
      <li>Here are solves with vertical I piece:</li>
      <li>Here are horizontal I piece solves:</li>
    </ul>
    <p><a href="https://four.lol/perfect-clears/opener">https://four.lol/perfect-clears/opener</a> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Not used much but better than PCO</li>
      <li>Can be made every 1 out of 5 bags</li>
      <li>Here is the patterns to learn:</li>
      <li>Here are the solves:</li>
    </ul>
    <p><a href="https://four.lol/perfect-clears/grace-system">https://four.lol/perfect-clears/grace-system</a> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Jaws is a 100% pattern to remember, but it has many complex solves to remember</li>
      <li>This is only good to learn if you really want a secure way to PC</li>
      <li>Solves are covered in this video by kvodeth (link in description)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFHmfsjGNj8&amp;ab_channel=kvodeth">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFHmfsjGNj8&amp;ab_channel=kvodeth</a>

    <ul>
      <li>An 'easy' way to get a PC with a 69-74%</li>
      <li>Easy to memorise and better for getting points in blitz</li>
      <li>You can build 2nd pc on top, making it consistent for loops
      </li>
      <li>2 shapes: PCO and Jaws</li>
      <li>Solves can be found in video by smolfeesh (there are quite a few) (link in description)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>2l PC</p>
    <p>There is a chance to get a 2 line PC, though it is rare</p>
    <p>Just memorise them and see if your next queue has the required pieces after a pc solve to do a
      2l</p>
    <p>2nd PC</p>
    <p>After your initial PC you will have 4 pieces to spare</p>
    <p>These are used to create a setup to solve</p>
    <p>The PC solve uses 6 pieces from the next bag, leaving 1 piece to spare for 3rd PC</p>
    <p>Outro</p>
    <p>That's all for this video, but there is definitely more to discover about PC's</p>
    <p>This took WAY TOO LONG to make and edit so</p>

    <p>THE PERFECT CLEARS</p>
    <p>Look out for part 2, which will come out '<i>soon</i>'</p>
    <p>PART 2</p>
    <p>Welcome back to the PC tutorial/guide</p>
    <p>This video is the second part of the PC tutorial</p>
    <p>This is a shorter video but necessary to understand why PCs work</p>
    <p>Lets get right into it</p>
    <p>The randomiser</p>
    <p>To understand loops, you must understand the bag system</p>
    <p>This is the system tetrio uses to randomise the pieces</p>
    <p>This can be imagined like a hat/bag, with all 7 pieces in</p>
    <p>Each piece is randomly drawn until all of them have been taken out</p>
    <p>Then a fresh bag is created and the cycle repeats</p>
    <p>For Tetris, this means you are guaranteed each of the piece types once per 7 pieces</p>
    <p>This is why openers work, because you can guarantee a s,z,t,o,I,l and j piece each time</p>
    <p>If you have done openers for long by now, you would have realised this as well</p>
    <p>How PC loop works</p>
    <p>When you do a four height pc, you clear 4 lines (duh)</p>
    <p>If each line is 10 blocks, and each piece is 4 blocks, it takes 2.5 pieces to clear a line</p>
    <p>This means it takes 10 pieces to do a 4l PC</p>
    <p>This means for the first PC, you used 7 pieces from the 'first bag of pieces' and then 3 from
      the 'next bag'</p>
    <p>This can be visualised better using a line separating each bag, as well as the piece counter
    </p>
    <p>PC loop example</p>
    <p>See how 7 pieces from the first bag were used for the setup</p>
    <p>Then 3 from the next bag were used for the solve</p>
    <p>This leaves 4 pieces from the next bag</p>
    <p>Which are used for the setup of your next pc</p>
    <p>This pc is called 2nd PC, because it's the 2/7 pc done in the
      loop</p>
    <p>But in order to solve the PC, 6 more pieces are needed, as 10 (total pieces needed for pc)
      4 (pieces used for setup) leaves 6</p>
    <p>So after solving this pc, a remainder piece is left, which is in your hold queue</p>
    <p>PC Loop</p>
    <p>This goes on until 7 PCs are done, which is where there are no remainder pieces from
      previous bags</p>
    <p>If you want to know all the extra pieces and what bags are used, here is a chart from four.lol showing this:
    </p>
    <p>Also a useful method if you forgot what pc you are on (from hosef video):</p>
    <p>Look at your piece counter on the left</p>
    <p>Multiply that by 5</p>
    <p>Use mod(7) and finally add 1</p>
    <p>Here's a worked example:</p>
    <p>I have 865 pieces, so I do 865*5 = 4325</p>
    <p>( 4325 Mod 7 ) + 1 = 7</p>
    <p>Therefore I'm on 7th PC</p>
    <p>And 7th pc setups are also really easy to do, so this is pretty
      good</p>
    <p>Show 7th pc</p>
    <p>Part 3</p>
    <p>Welcome back to the PC tutorial/guide</p>
    <p>This video is the 3rd part of the PC tutorial</p>
    <p>This part will cover: 3rd PC and onwards in PC looping</p>
    <p>Lets get right into it</p>
    <p>8 line PC openers</p>
    <p>8 line openers mean that it takes 8 lines to do, ending with a perfect clear</p>
    <p>This also means it is loopable with the help of DPC</p>
    <p>There are way too many openers that achieve this</p>
    <p>And some openers here are better off having its own video, but ill show them off anyway</p>

    <p>DPC</p>
    <p>This is what you do after an 8 line PC, which involves clearing a TSD and ending with a PC,
    </p>
    <p>This topic is covered in this video, which you should learn to complete the loop</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_0I1Mbldh0&amp;ab_channel=TitanPlayz100">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_0I1Mbldh0&amp;ab_channel=TitanPlayz100</a>
    </p>
    <p>The basics of dpc are that you have a spare piece after 8 line pc is cleared, as seen in this
      table at 3rd PC:</p>
    <p>So according to what piece you have left over, you make a setup (built 100% of the time) and
      complete a TSD, then a PC after usually having a high chance and <i>easy </i>memorisation
    </p>
    <p>Notice how this basically skips 4 PCs and goes back to the start</p>
    <p>This Is because clearing 2l PCs will advance you 4 PCs</p>
    <p>2 Line PCs</p>
    <p>This brings us on the next part, 2 line pcs</p>
    <p>In the first video, I showed you these setups to memorise</p>
    <p>But I failed to explain how these relate to the pc loop</p>
    <p>Well, if you complete a 2 line pc, done mostly on 2nd, 3rd and 4th pc, this will advance you 4 pcs</p>
    <p>Lets look at the chart again</p>
    <p>Say I did a 2 line pc on 3rd</p>
    <p>I will go to 7th pc <i>do animation</i></p>
    <p>Btw this is tsz 7th which is REALLY easy 100% pc</p>
    <p>But why is this</p>
    <p>The simplest explanation is that when doing a 4 line pc, you go forward 1 pc in the loop,
      which also means going 8 forward</p>
    <p>A 2l pc is half of a 4l pc, so you will go half the amount forward, which is 4</p>
    <p>Another way of thinking is the remaining pieces</p>
    <p>When you do a pc you have leftover pieces in a bag</p>
    <p>Say you are on 3rd , you will use 7+2 from next bag and end up
      leaving 5 for 4th PC </p>
    <p>But when doing 2 line PC, you use half the pieces, so instead of using 10 total you only use 5
    </p>
    <p>So you use only 1 leftover and 4 from the bag, leaving 3 remaining pieces from same bag rather
      than leaving 7+2</p>
    <p>On the chart you can see that 7th PC, which is 4 after 3rd PC, has 2 remaining</p>
    <p>3rd PC and onwards</p>
    <p>If you want to go for the 10 PC badge, or you are just PRO, you can learn the whole loop</p>
    <p>referring to the chart again</p>
    <p>starting at 3rd PC</p>
    <p>You have 1 spare piece, and will use the next 9 pieces to solve it</p>
    <p>First you have to determine what the remaining piece is, like dpc</p>
    <p>Now you make a setup according to this … like dpc</p>
    <p>Setups can be found on four.lol (some are pretty meh), or going to pc gang discord and in the
      setups channel</p>
    <p>4th PC to 6th PC are the 'freestyle
      pcs', which mean you basically look at your queue and determine setups that have a good chance to pc</p>
    <p>Here are some of those setups (ye pcs also have setups, not just tspins):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Braindead</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Dragon</li>
    </ul>
    <p>(I found these setups from hosef and smolfeesh so go support them!)</p>
    <p>Now once you get to 7th you basically have a free PC, because
      these 3 piece setups are very simple and have mostly 100% chance to pc</p>
    <p>Four.lol gives an extensive list of all of these, and there are more advanced setups on pc
      gang</p>
    <p>From 4th to 6th there are also
      specific setups, but honestly freestyling is much better off</p>
    <p>If you do want these setups I have linked some down in description, also found in pc gang's
      setup channel</p>
