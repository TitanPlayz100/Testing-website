    <h1>The Modern Tetris Dictionary</h1>
    <div>
      <h2>
        General terms
      </h2>

      <p>Upstacking - Stacking upwards on the board, making it higher and creating more attack to send</p>
      <p>Downstacking - Stacking downwards by clearing lines and garbage, as well as sending attack through combos</p>
      <p>Line clear types - The amount of lines cleared with one piece determines line clear type e.g. single, double,
        triple, quad</p>
      <p>Garbage - gray lines that opponent sent through attacking you that have one hole in them</p>
      <p>Cheese - when many garbage holes that are 1 or 2 high are present and don't line up well </p>
      <p>Combo - done through consecutive line clears to send cheese to opponent</p>
      <p>BTB - back to back is when you only clear quads or tspins, but it doesn't need to be consecutive line clears
      </p>
      <p>PC (perfect clear / all clear) - when all the blocks on the board are cleared, sending 10 attack</p>
      <p>T-spin / tspin - when you spin the T piece in a hole to double its attack depending on its line clear type e.g.
        TSD sends 4 lines, TSS sends 2 lines</p>
      <p>Misdrop - a misinput, or where a piece is unintentionally placed</p>
      <p>Early game /opening / beginning - the start of a game, usually lead with an opener</p>
      <p>Midgame - usually period of gameplay after an opener is completed to the end of the game, which may not happen
        due to early topout</p>
      <p>Spike - a large amount of attack (usually more than 10) sent in a short amount of time</p>
      <p>Multiplier - the way a high attack such as quad or TSD is multiplied after a large combo, prevalent in TETR.IO
      </p>
      <p>Top out / block out / lock out - when you place a piece or a piece is placed out over the board
      <p>7-bag - the randomiser system that all the main modern games use to randomise the pieces, where for example
        there
        is a bag, and each piece is taken out of the bag until it is empty, then it repeats with a fresh new one</p>
      <p>lock delay, amount of time in frames that a piece on the board will take to lock of place when at the bottom
      </p>
      <p>ARR - Auto repeat rate, amount of time it takes after das is engaged for a piece to move to the next column</p>
      <p>DAS - amount of time after an initial input left or right until it automatically starts moving</p>
      <p>SDF - Soft Drop Factor, how fast the soft drop speed of a piece is</p>
      <p>Gameplay styles - </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Strider: plays fast but with low efficiency, thus sending lower attack than usual
        </li>
        <li>Plonker: plays slow but with high efficiency, sending more attack than usual
        </li>
        <li>opener main: can setup an opener very fast but usually suffers during midgame
        </li>
        <li>inf ds (infinite downstackers): tanks attack and sends it back through downstackign
        </li>
        <li>ppt (puyo puyo tetris) player: plays with high efficiency and has high arr and das to maintain feel of puyo
          puyo tetris</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Rank - the amount of TR you have in tetra league determines rank, and the ranks from highest to lowest are: X,
        U, SS, S+, S, S-, A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D</p>

      <h2>
        Tspins
      </h2>

      <p>Tspin double (tsd) - t spin double orrurs when you spin a t into a t shaped hole, where 3 out of 4 corners are
        filled in and the last move was a twist, as well as the amount of lines cleared being 2</p>
      <p>Tspin single (tss) - t spin single is a tsd but only clearing 1 line</p>
      <p>Tspin triple (tst) - t spin triple occurs when a t is kicked into a t shaped hole where all corners are filled,
        clearing 3 lines</p>
      <p>Tspin mini - a lenient way of awarding a tspin, thouh they don't give bonus attack and only maintain BTB</p>
      <p>Fractal - 2 tsds stacked directly on top of each other </p>
      <p>Cut Copy, 2 tsds that can be performed right after each other where the overhang of one is used for the other
      </p>
      <p>Dt - tspin double which creates a tspin triple right after</p>
      <p>Cspin - tspin triple which creates a tspin double right after</p>
      <p>Kaidan - tspin double using staircase shape near edge of board</p>
      <p>Stmb cave - floating tspin double using s and z</p>
      <p>Stsd - 2 tspin doubles where the first tspin is performed like a TST but only clearing 2 lines, which then
        creates a 2nd TSD
      <p>Imperial cross - TSD into TSD, first tsd performed like a TST, but only clearing 2 lines, shape looks like a
        cross</p>
      <p>Fin/Iso/Neo tspins - abuses certain t kicks to perform tspin in unintuitive way</p>

      <p>Counting to 4/5 - counting 4 rows up to guarantee a quad, or counting 5 rows up to guarantee a quad and tspin</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>Attack - garbage lines sent to the opponent after a line clear. When in the context of a whole bag, the type of line clear that sends garbage within the bag.</p>
      <p>Back-to-back - (abbr. B2B) consecutive line clears where each line clear is either a Tetris, or a T-Spin.</p>
      <p>Bag - a group of seven pieces so that each of the seven possible tetrominoes appears exactly once. For example, first bag, or bag 1, refers to the first seven pieces, which will always have exactly one of each piece.</p>
      <p>Combo - clearing lines with consecutive pieces.</p>
      <p>Kick - When a tetromino rotates, but would be blocked, forcing the game to look through a table to shift the piece so that it can be rotated.</p>
      <p>Perfect clear - (abbr. PC) also All Clear, Bravo. Clearing the whole board, so there are no minos remaining on the board.</p>
      <p>Soft drop - dropping a piece without it locking. Opposed to hard drop, which means dropping a piece and locking it immediately after.</p>

      <h2>Types of openers</h2>

      <p>Counterspike opener - an opener that builds a large T-Spin setup, so that they can be executed quickly to send a lot of garbage lines. These openers benefit from clean garbage, which may allow them to combo in a Tetris as well, sending even more garbage.</p>
      <p>DT opener - an opener that sets up a Double Triple Cannon. Can sometimes refer to an opener that sends a T-Spin Double on the first bag, and then a T-Spin Triple on the second bag, without building a Double Triple Cannon. Not to be confused with DT Cannon opener, which refers to one opener that is very commonly used by beginners.</p>
      <p>Freestyle opener - an opener that requires the player to stack freestyle early, usually in the second bag.</p>
      <p>PC opener - An opener that sends a Perfect Clear, usually after 4, 6 or 8 lines cleared. Not to be confused with Perfect Clear Opener, or PCO, which refers to a popular opener.</p>
      <p>TD opener - an opener that sets up a Triple Double, usually on the second bag.</p>
      <p>TSD opener - an opener where the first attack is a T-Spin Double. This includes openers where the first bag has no attack but sets up a T-Spin Double on the second bag.</p>
      <p>TSS opener - an opener that begins with a first bag T-Spin Single.</p>

      <h2>Other terminology</h2>

      <p>180 spins - also 180s, 180 rotations. The ability to rotate a piece 180 degrees, which on an unconstricted board has the same effect as rotating counterclockwise or clockwise twice.</p>
      <p>Dependency (1) - a hole in the board that can only be filled with specific pieces.</p>
      <p>Dependency (2) - (in the context of a bag) a specific ordering of pieces within a bag that allows a setup to be completed.</p>
      <p>Fumen - an online tool used to show Tetris setups. Often used to generally describe a diagram showing setups.</p>
