    <div>
      <h2>
        General terms
      </h2>

      <p>Upstacking - Stacking upwards on the board, making it higher and creating more attack to send</p>
      <p>Downstacking - Stacking downwards by clearing lines and garbage, as well as sending attack through combos</p>
      <p>Line clear types - The amount of lines cleared with one piece determines line clear type e.g. single, double,
        triple, quad</p>
      <p>Garbage - gray lines that opponent sent through attacking you that have one hole in them</p>
      <p>Cheese - when many garbage holes that are 1 or 2 high are present and don't line up well </p>
      <p>Combo - done through consecutive line clears to send cheese to opponent</p>
      <p>BTB - back to back is when you only clear quads or tspins, but it doesn't need to be consecutive line clears
      </p>
      <p>PC (perfect clear / all clear) - when all the blocks on the board are cleared, sending 10 attack</p>
      <p>T-spin / tspin - when you spin the T piece in a hole to double its attack depending on its line clear type e.g.
        TSD sends 4 lines, TSS sends 2 lines</p>
      <p>Misdrop - a misinput, or where a piece is unintentionally placed</p>
      <p>Early game /opening / beginning - the start of a game, usually lead with an opener</p>
      <p>Midgame - usually period of gameplay after an opener is completed to the end of the game, which may not happen
        due to early topout</p>
      <p>Spike - a large amount of attack (usually more than 10) sent in a short amount of time</p>
      <p>Multiplier - the way a high attack such as quad or TSD is multiplied after a large combo, prevalent in TETR.IO
      </p>
      <p>Top out / block out / lock out - when you place a piece or a piece is placed out over the board
      <p>7-bag - the randomiser system that all the main modern games use to randomise the pieces, where for example
        there
        is a bag, and each piece is taken out of the bag until it is empty, then it repeats with a fresh new one</p>
      <p>lock delay, amount of time in frames that a piece on the board will take to lock of place when at the bottom
      </p>
      <p>ARR - Auto repeat rate, amount of time it takes after das is engaged for a piece to move to the next column</p>
      <p>DAS - amount of time after an initial input left or right until it automatically starts moving</p>
      <p>SDF - Soft Drop Factor, how fast the soft drop speed of a piece is</p>
      <p>Gameplay styles - </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Strider: plays fast but with low efficiency, thus sending lower attack than usual
        </li>
        <li>Plonker: plays slow but with high efficiency, sending more attack than usual
        </li>
        <li>opener main: can setup an opener very fast but usually suffers during midgame
        </li>
        <li>inf ds (infinite downstackers): tanks attack and sends it back through downstackign
        </li>
        <li>ppt (puyo puyo tetris) player: plays with high efficiency and has high arr and das to maintain feel of puyo
          puyo tetris</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Rank - the amount of TR you have in tetra league determines rank, and the ranks from highest to lowest are: X,
        U, SS, S+, S, S-, A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D</p>

    <div>
      <h2>
        Tspins
      </h2>

      <p>Tspin double (tsd) - t spin double orrurs when you spin a t into a t shaped hole, where 3 out of 4 corners are
        filled in and the last move was a twist, as well as the amount of lines cleared being 2</p>
      <p>Tspin single (tss) - t spin single is a tsd but only clearing 1 line</p>
      <p>Tspin triple (tst) - t spin triple occurs when a t is kicked into a t shaped hole where all corners are filled,
        clearing 3 lines</p>
      <p>Tspin mini - a lenient way of awarding a tspin, thouh they don't give bonus attack and only maintain BTB</p>
      <p>Fractal - 2 tsds stacked directly on top of each other </p>
      <p>Cut Copy, 2 tsds that can be performed right after each other where the overhang of one is used for the other
      </p>
      <p>Dt - tspin double which creates a tspin triple right after</p>
      <p>Cspin - tspin triple which creates a tspin double right after</p>
      <p>Kaidan - tspin double using staircase shape near edge of board</p>
      <p>Stmb cave - floating tspin double using s and z</p>
      <p>Stsd - 2 tspin doubles where the first tspin is performed like a TST but only clearing 2 lines, which then
        creates a 2nd TSD
      <p>Imperial cross - TSD into TSD, first tsd performed like a TST, but only clearing 2 lines, shape looks like a
        cross</p>
      <p>Fin/Iso/Neo tspins - abuses certain t kicks to perform tspin in unintuitive way</p>
      <p>Yoshihiro SD - tspin mini single leading into TSD on edge of board</p>
