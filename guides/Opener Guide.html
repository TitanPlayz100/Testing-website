    <h1>The Beginners Guide to Choosing an Opener</h1>
    <h2>Section 1: What are openers?</h1>
      <p><span>Starting from scratch, let's see how google defines opener:</span></p>
      <p><span>Opener, </span><span>noun:</span><span> a device for opening something, especially a container.
          Interesting, but what you're probably after is the other definition: the first in a series of events, games,
          or actions.</span></p>
      <p><span>Every game you play, every event, or every activity you have ever performed has a beginning. Do you
          remember what you started out with in your last game. Maybe you do, but it was probably a short thought, an
          irrelevant one that you had forgotten the moment you started the match. </span></p>
      <p><span>So what? Why should you care about the opening? I'll show you why.</span></p>

      <h3>How good are openers? </h3>
      <p><span>Let's take a game everyone watching is probably known with, tetr- chess. In chess, opening games are one
          of the most researched aspects of the game, and even harder to remember. But once you master a good line, it
          can feel like you can beat anyone who stands in yo- oh, you don't? Well, I'm sorry but I'm afraid you have
          something called a skill issue. Anyway, openers will always give you tactical advantages after they are
          performed, as well as improving your odds of winning by giving you a better position or stack or whatever you
          needed to win.</span></p>
      <p><span>So why does a person who uses an opener seems to always have an upper edge against those who don't. Well,
          being better than someone comes from skill, and skill comes from practice. The more times you do something the
          better you should get at it. The most frequent event that happens in every game is the beginning, so learning
          an opener beforehand will give you more skill in the beginning than an opponent who just arrived in the game
          unprepared. Practicing an opener beforehand will allow you to use a tool that has been refined and tested many
          times to give you the best advantage in the beginning. And as learning and practicing an opener is simple,
          making it easy to master and gain an advantage in just the opening segment.</span></p>

      <p>
      <h3>What about TETRIO?</h3>
      </p>

      <p>As I have said, this phenomenon occurs everywhere you go, but in TETR.IO its impacts are so major there's
        groups of people who have dedicated their entire playstyle to just opener. Why? In modern tetris, there is a
        thing called a 7bag randomiser, which basically puts all the pieces there are in a bag and randomly pulls them
        out until the bag is empty, where the bag is just refilled and repeated. This guarantees that the 7 unique
        pieces are guaranteed at the start, so depending on the order many different starting builds can be made. This
        concept has allowed numerous openers to be discovered, so much so that you could top out your opponent in the
        first 20 pieces with an opener that has a 100% chance to be built, requiring only memorising a total of 13 board
        states and its mirrors. But that's not all. Because you can memorise some more setups and send another 14+ lines
        and do that entire thing over and over in a repetitive cycle. What the hell. And this is only one opener. ONE.
        There is 400+ DOCUMENTED OPENERS (credits to Ivans database). I bet you couldn't even stack a tetris and a tspin
        in 20 pieces. But no. that's not all. You may be sitting there like “ye I can probably send 20 lines…: nerd:”
        But can you do it consistently, every single match. Can you practice that specific pattern over and over until
        you can flawlessly execute it at unfathomable speeds, only increasing as time passes, until it's become an
        unstoppable force.</p>

      <p>
      <h3>So then, what should I do to learn openers?</h3>
      </p>

      <p><span>Well, you're in luck, you can have this godlike power. And its ‘free' as well (see you after 100 hours of
          practice). The opener I described is called Mountainous Stacking 2 DPC loop, but I know there's X ranks
          cringing about how they can send 40 lines in 3 pieces with their Horsespin Amongus opener deez nuts variant
          (don't even think about it). It's probably better for you to get them for yourself…</span></p>

      <p>
      <h2>Section 2: What is an opener repertoire?</h2>
      </p>

      <p><span>You start a match and see the first pieces. You just practiced SDPC for 10 hours after that tutorial by
          TitanPlayz and are ready to destroy your opponents and take easy wins. You place the pieces aaaaaaaaand… wait
          what, I can't stack this, where's the o piece??? Then you top out instantly because you know nothing
          else</span></p>
      <p><span>If this is you, God bless you because you are gonna need it. To everyone else, here's how to expand your
          opener knowledge so you're not left in the dust at the start of every game. An opener repertoire is your
          arsenal of openers that you can deploy in every game and will give you an advantage compared to an unprepared
          player. The openers in your arsenal are determined by different categories and having at least one good one
          for each will cover you for a variety of situations. Every game has a beginning that is predictable, as the
          only factor is the piece randomiser. This is one of the reasons there are many openers. They can also boost
          your ability to transition to midgame, and sometimes improving midgame techniques as well as mechanical skill.
          This is why you should have a repertoire of your own. </span></p>

      <p>
      <h3>So how do I make one?</h3>
      </p>

      <p><span>There are a multitude of steps to create a set of openers that you can use, which I feel like are easy
          enough to follow. First, list out every opener you learn or plan to learn in the future. But how? Well, by
          going through the internet you might have found some great places to learn openers such as YouTube, four.lol,
          harddrop wiki or even Ivans opener database. You may have also learned them from other people in game or irl.
          After visiting these sites, you should have a good idea of what you want to play, or maybe not, that's also
          fine. You should still list the openers down somewhere to keep track, and near the end of the video I'll
          suggest some great openers to learn, as well as show you some ‘professional advice'.</span></p>
      <p><span>Now categorise the openers, and its fine to put one opener in multiple or make now categories. The
          categories I have made are based of playstyles, which I have explained later, but feel free to do whatever
          categories you want. The ones I choose are: Consistent pressure opener, spike opener, looping or PC opener,
          and the 100% opener. Finally sort and cut down on opener based on each category until you are happy with the
          choice. I'll show an example of this process later in the video. Let me explain the categories more indepth.
          Some categories are based on countering a certain playstyle, so if you're against an apm spammer you should go
          for openers that you can use to counterspike with. If it's a downstacker go spike opener. If it's an opener
          main go looping, and if you don't know go pressure opener or 100% opener. I will make a playstyle guide in the
          future to explain this thought process, so stay tuned and subscribe as well if you definitely want more like
          this.</span></p>

      <p>
      <h3>Where should I go to learn openers?</h3>
      </p>

      <p><span>As I've listed before, some resources to discover openers are four.lol (this one is more for beginners),
          harddrop wiki, or if you want some variety use Ivan database of openers or swng's website to search for one,
          all of which I've linked in the description.</span></p>
      <p><span>However, to practice these you should use 0 gravity and infinite lock delay boards to start off with and
          improve, such as Tetrio's Zen mode, Jstris modes or this excellent website called blox.askplays.com which has
          an opener practice gamemode.</span></p>
      <p><span>My final list can aid me for every fight I'm in (but it can't if I misdrop it all the time). I also have
          asked some other pros for what they use and they have some good suggestions for perfectly fine repertoires
          which also follow the principles I've laid down as well.</span></p>

      <p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      </p>

      <p><span>But remember kids, openers improve the start of a game, and only the start of a game. The moment you
          finish an opener, you're by yourself. So, make sure you're not the one stranded in the middle of an island and
          learn midgame please. </span></p>
