    <h1>TKI tutorial</h1>

    <div><p>Welcome to the TKI tutorial. This will cover most things about TKI that you may need to memorise, because there
      are things I cannot teach, which TKI can provide which is why it is SO good.</p>
    <p>This is an incredibly versatile opener, with many, many different paths to follow. Paths is an arbitrary term
      here though because there are so many different things you can do that you can think of. There may as well be a
      whole Discord server for finding TKI routes (unlikely though lmao). </p>
    <p>This tutorial will go in-depth on very basic but fundamental concepts for TKI, and branch of into other routes
      that will help you learn the basics of even T-spinning. This is the best opener for beginners as well as the
      worst, because while it may teach T-spins in a very practical way, it can be impossible for beginners to follow up
      with more. </p>
    <p>HOWEVER, there are several common paths that are able to be memorised and executed well, including LST stacking,
      and imp cross to pc, or even just 6L PCs. </p></div>

    <div><h3>TKI fundamentals:</h3>
    <p>TKI is a first bag TSD opener, with many paths to use from the get-go. TKI generally needs an early I piece, but
      sometimes you can get away with I-spins. This opener provides many continuations of varying degree and NO wasted
      T's, is a hard counter to SDPC if matched evenly, you can 'bail out' of the opener early (thanks WAWI) but lacks
      the 'braindead feel' of openers; you may have to think more to use this. It also is not exactly beginner friendly.
    </p></div>

    <div><h3>Flat Top</h3>
    <p>The most common path to follow is called flat top for its â€¦ flat top, has the most versatility and practicality,
      commonly used to go into LST stacking. </p>
    <h4>LST</h4>
    <p>LST stacking is a 'fundamental' way of learning t-spins, but can be hard to get the hang of, even I can't LST
      well. Thank god others can, such as Diao and Kazu, with relevant viewing sources in the description. Before LST,
      you need to do a 2nd tspin, which comes in varying patterns that are easy to learn.
    </p>
    <h4>PC</h4>
    <p>There is also an 8L PC at 42 to 77% chance after this 2nd TSD, but the LST stack
      provides so much more. </p>
    <p>The keyword for this is versatility though, so if you are capable try deviate form this and go make new paths to
      offset your opponent. </p>
    <h4>Imperial cross</h4>
    <p>Another route from flat top is an imperial cross into 8L PC (80 to 89%), but this needs an early J and O to get a
      PC, so its not widely common. </p>
    <h4>TST Tower</h4>
    <p>From four.lol there is this TST tower route which is not recommended IMO. </p></div>

    <div><h3>CASTLE TOP</h3>
    <p>The next route from TKI is the castle top variation, which can lead to the same situations as flat top, such as
      the imperial cross and 8L PC, but also has a high chance to 6L PC (Early O or L after tspin). This can also flat
      out be turned in to a fractal or other tspin techniques, which is why I will repeat: Make your own paths! </p>
    <h4>TSM into Cspin</h4>
    <p>Next there is the TSM setup which translates to a Cspin setup that deals a bit more than 2 TSDs and leaves quite
      a clean board to follow up on easier with more Tspins, or downstack. </p>

    <h3>FONZIE</h3>
    <p>The final and easiest to make tspins is from the Fonzie route, which is because it gives the best board after the
      first tspin to make more tspins. However, this would only work for people who already have great tspin vision. It
      also has a 6L PC.</p>
    <p>It can also be easily translated into LST stacking:</p></div>
