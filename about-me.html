        <h2  id="title 1">Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>I'm known as TitanPlayz, titanplayz100 or shrekans100. I am mainly known for making content on Youtube, specifically tetris related guides. While I'm not the greatest at keeping a consistent upload schedule, I do mostly make sure each video is better then the other (please ignore the meme ones). I make tutorials, guides, compilations, montages and funny meme videos, and willing to make any other video suggested.</p>
        <p>I also play a <i>lot</i> of TETR.IO, a stacker (basically tetris) game. I know a variety of techniques and have developed ok skills at clearing lines (interpret that as you want), and I have reached top 2% in ranking (U rank - 24100), top 500 blitz and 500 hours. I also have won a superlobby, finished 40 lines with 10 PCs, and freestyle 20 tsd. I would consider myself as a somewhat ok player but definately has a long way to go before becoming good at the game</p>
        <p>I also have recently been coding, specifically a minecraft plugin which is remaking Hypixel's Skyclash in java. Its a very large project made by many people, so that's pretty cool ig. Also, technically this website has been another thing I have been coding, which means I had to learn html and css, and is definately not heavily inspired by four.lol</p>
